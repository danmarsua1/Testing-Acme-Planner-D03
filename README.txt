!!!ATTENTION NOTES!!!
1.Due to conflict with the Tomcat Manager App (usually <app_name>/manager) of the Clever-Cloud server, 
both in classes, attributes and entities, it has been decided to rename the role called "Manager" 
to "Usermanager".

2.It has been decided to create a separate repository due to potential problems that could 
occur when logging into the Clever Cloud application during this third deliverable, as it 
manages dates that depend on the time of insertion, and to avoid interfering with the 
corrections of the second deliverable project.
